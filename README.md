# python-calculator

A command-line based calculator application built using Python.  
This project supports both binary and unary mathematical operations using Python's built-in "math" module.

#Features

~Binary Operations
- Addition (`+`)
- Subtraction (`-`)
- Multiplication (`*`)
- Division (`/`)
- Modulus (`%`)

~Unary Operations
- Square Root (`sqrt`)
- Logarithm (`log`)
- Trigonometric Functions:
  - Sine (`sin`)
  - Cosine (`cos`)
  - Tangent (`tan`)

> Trigonometric inputs are taken in degrees and internally converted to radians.
